# Unreal-Engine-5-CPP-Samples
C++ samples for Unreal Engine 5 development. Made with reference to the <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-5-5-documentation">Unreal Engine 5.5 documentation</a> programming tutorials, because I felt like there was a lack of resources available for developers who already are familiar with C++, and are looking for examples of how to use it in the context of Unreal. 

### Using these samples
Copy the desired header and C++ files into your UE5 project, rebuild the project, then open the project in the editor. The desired functionality should be added to the project. Each sample may require an initial scene setup before use.

## Samples

### Custom Actor Class: Levitating Actor with Particle Effect

In the content browser, drag the Levitating Actor class from the C++ Classes folder into the scene.
